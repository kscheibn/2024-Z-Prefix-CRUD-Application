## Could not get build app for deployment
I was previously running an outdated version of next-auth. The code functioned on my development server, but I ran into dependency conflicts when trying to deploy the app. After upgrading next-auth, I began running into authentication issues with code, and I am still experiencing issues with building/deploying. 

The code does, however, run (with stated limitations) on my development server. 

User credentials:

username: testing
password: testing123


## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
